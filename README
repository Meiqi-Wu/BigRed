The Whole Story: 
	We were inspired by Mofi from IBM to build something that could potentially make the Section 8 application process a little better for those who need it. Currently, the application for Section 8 takes at the least 2 years and we believed that the time could be shortened by offering reviewers a model that will be able to recognize whether a application would be accepted or not.
